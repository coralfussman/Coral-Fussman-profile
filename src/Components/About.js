                <h3> ∅ History ∅ </h3>
                     <p>In my past life, I  Studied <b>design</b> in New York for seven years, at the top ranked, and most competitive design school in the states, FIT. <br/>
                     Having set my sites on sportswear and hi-tech fashion, I moved to Milan to tap into Europe's broader hi-tech fashion market, learning the craft
                     <br/>at Politecnico di Milano. My mission was simple, the sciences and the arts should exist in elegant, effortless harmony. <b>Fashion</b> 
                      <br/>and <b>technology</b> can live in <b>symbiosis</b>, for the purpose of <b>utility</b> and <b>aesthetics</b>. I came back to the states
                      <br/> with a hunger to innovate. Starting with my first job out of school creating space suits at Final Frontier Design. 
                      <br/> Since then, I have developed an insatiable desire to <b>improve performance</b> across a range of fields not 
                      <br/>limited to fashion. All stemming from the same underlying need to continue moving <b>forward</b>.

                <h3> ∅ Currently ∅ </h3>
                    <p> Having been cursed and blessed with the inability to 'chill',  <br/>
                        I'm always on to the next <b>adventure</b>. My free time is occupied with  <br/>
                        building small <b>apps</b> to learn new skills, attending <b>webinars</b> and lectures, <br/>
                        as well as <b>volunteering</b> with small groups on projects. Anyone who's ever worked with<br/>
                        me also knows I have a million tabs open of articles I'm currently <b>reading and testing</b>. <br/>
                        So subsequently, my remaining time is spent catching up on my chrome <b>bookmarks</b>, my reading list, and<br/> 
                        learning to use my dad's black magic camera. I then use the content to play around in Adobe Photoshop and Premiere.
