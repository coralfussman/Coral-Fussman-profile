                <h3> ∅ History ∅ </h3>
                     <p> Studied <b>Design</b> in New York for seven years, thoroughly immersed in the fashion & Art scene.<br/>
                    Lived abroad in Milan for a year working on my thesis. My mission simple, the sciences and the arts should<br/>
                     exist in elegant, effortless harmony. <b>Fashion</b> and <b>technology</b> can live in <b>symbiosis</b>, for the purpose  <br/>
                      of <b>utility</b> and <b>aesthetics</b>.  I came back to the state with a hunger to innovate. Starting with my first<br/>
                      job out of school creating space suits. Since then,
                      I have developed a an insatiable desire <br/>
                      to <b>improve performance</b> across a range of fields not limited to fashion.
                     <br/>Stemming from an underlying need to continue moving <b>forward</b>.

                <h3> ∅ Currently ∅ </h3>
                    <p> I don't really have a <b>"netflix and chill"</b> bone in my body.  <br/>
                    I'm always on to the next <b>adventure</b>. So in my free time I've been  <br/>
                    building small <b>apps</b> to learn new skills, attending <b>webinars</b> and lectures, <br/>
                    as well as <b>volunteering</b> with small groups on projects. Anyone who's ever worked  <br/>
                    with me also knows I have a million tabs open of articles I'm currently <b>reading and testing</b>. <br/>
                    Therefore my remaining time is spent catching up on my chrome <b>bookmarks</b>, my reading list, and<br/> 
                    learning to use my dad's black magic camera. I use the content to play around in Adobe Photoshop and Premiere.
