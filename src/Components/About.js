                <h3> ∅ History ∅ </h3>
                     <p>In my past life, I  studied <b>design</b> in New York for seven years, at the top ranked, and most competitive design school in the States, FIT. <br/>
                     Having set my sites on sportswear and hi-tech fashion, I moved to Milan to tap into Europe's broader hi-tech fashion market, learning the craft
                     <br/>at Politecnico di Milano. My mission was simple, the sciences and the arts should exist in elegant, effortless harmony. <b>Fashion</b> 
                      <br/>and <b>technology</b> can live in <b>symbiosis</b>, for the purpose of <b>utility</b> and <b>aesthetics</b>. I came back to the States with
                      <br/> a hunger to innovate, starting with my first job out of school creating space suits at Final Frontier Design. 
                      <br/> Since then, I have developed an insatiable desire to <b>improve performance</b> across a range of fields, not 
                      <br/>limited to fashion. All stemming from the same underlying need to continue moving <b>forward</b>.

                <h3> ∅ Currently ∅ </h3>
                    <p> Being the type of person who can't remain static,  <br/>
                        I'm always on to the next <b> undertaking </b>. My free time is occupied <br/>
                        with building small <b>apps</b> to learn new skills, attending <b>webinars</b> and  <br/>
                        lectures, as well as <b>volunteering</b> with small groups on projects. Anyone who's ever  <br/>
                        worked with me knows I have a million tabs open of articles I'm currently <b>reading and testing</b>. <br/>
                        So naturally, my remaining time is spent catching up on my chrome <b>bookmarks</b>, or my reading list. When I'm not<br/> 
                        nerd-ing out, I'm also learning to use my dad's Black Magic camera, using the content to practice in Adobe Photoshop and Premiere.
